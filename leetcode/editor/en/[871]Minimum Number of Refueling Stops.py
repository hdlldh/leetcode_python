# A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles 
# east of the starting position. 
# 
#  Along the way, there are gas stations. Each station[i] represents a gas stati
# on that is station[i][0] miles east of the starting position, and has station[i]
# [1] liters of gas. 
# 
#  The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel li
# ters of fuel in it. It uses 1 liter of gas per 1 mile that it drives. 
# 
#  When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all 
# the gas from the station into the car. 
# 
#  What is the least number of refueling stops the car must make in order to rea
# ch its destination? If it cannot reach the destination, return -1. 
# 
#  Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can stil
# l refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still
#  considered to have arrived. 
# 
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []
# Output: 0
# Explanation: We can reach the target without refueling.
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: We can't reach the target (or even the first gas station).
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,4
# 0]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# We start with 10 liters of fuel.
# We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters
#  to 60 liters of gas.
# Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),
# and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach the
#  target.
# We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.
#  
# 
#  
# 
#  Note: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= target, startFuel, stations[i][1] <= 10^9 
#  0 <= stations.length <= 500 
#  0 < stations[0][0] < stations[1][0] < ... < stations[stations.length-1][0] < 
# target

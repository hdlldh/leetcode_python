# You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height. The bil
# lboard will have two steel supports, one on each side. Each steel support must b
# e an equal height. 
# 
#  You have a collection of rods which can be welded together. For example, if y
# ou have rods of lengths 1, 2, and 3, you can weld them together to make a suppor
# t of length 6. 
# 
#  Return the largest possible height of your billboard installation. If you can
# not support the billboard, return 0. 
# 
#  
# 
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: [1,2,3,6]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: We have two disjoint subsets {1,2,3} and {6}, which have the same
#  sum = 6.
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Output: 10
# Explanation: We have two disjoint subsets {2,3,5} and {4,6}, which have the sa
# me sum = 10.
#  
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: [1,2]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The billboard cannot be supported, so we return 0.
#  
#  
# 
#  
# 
#  Note: 
# 
#  
#  0 <= rods.length <= 20 
#  1 <= rods[i] <= 1000 
#  The sum of rods is at most 5000.
